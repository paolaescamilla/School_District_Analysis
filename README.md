# School District Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis

The following analysis takes math and reading scores from 9th to 12th grade students of various schools of the district with the purpose of analyzing school performance for school budget distribution.

## Results

Initially, the analysis was done with the final math and reading scores of 9th to 12th grade students and overall information of the schools. However, it was notified to the School Board that 9th grade grades from Thomas High School (THS) were altered therefore the analysis was rerun excluding such grades for a more accurate representation of the information.

How was the district summary affected?

On the first analysis, the district summary gave the following output:

For the second analysis, withdrawing 9th grades for THS, the output was as follows:

The most altered differences were perceived in the average math score, the passing math percentage, the passing reading percentage and the overall passing percentage. The very minimun variations show that the alteration of grades in 9th grade, even though a serious matter, do not alter significantly the overall district summary.

How was the school summary affected?

On the first analysis, the school summary gave the following output:

For the second analysis, withdrawing 9th grades for THS, the output was as follows:

THS's performance:
- The performance of THS suffers a very slight variation. The final number of 9th graders was less compared to the total sum of 10th to 12th. 

Replace of the 9th grade scores:
- Replacing the ninth-grade scores does not affect math and reading scores notoriously. As previously said, the proportion of 9th grades compared to the total population of grades is low.
- For this reason, the scores based on school spending, school size and school type suffered slight to no variation.


## Summary 
The four major changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores were replaced were:
1. Average math score decreased from 79 to 78.9
2. Passing math percentage decreased from 75% to 74.8%
3. Passing reading percentage decreased from 86% to 85.7%
4. The overall passing percentage decreased from 65% to 64.9%
